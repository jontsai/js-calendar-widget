js-calendar-widget
==================

Description
-----------
A Google Calendar-like widget built using JavaScript/CSS/HTML and YUI. For custom calendar displays

Getting started
---------------
1. Clone the project from GitHub
   git://github.com/jontsai/js-calendar-widget.git
2. Drop the files in your project and go!

It is recommended to place any style customizations in a separate CSS file.

Somewhere in your JavaScript and before you include calendar.js, you need to implement a function called getExternalEvents(), which must return a JSON object of events formatted as follows:
    // events = { 'YYYY-MM-DD' : [ { time: 'HH:MM (24-Hours)', content: 'HTML Markup' }, { ... } ], ... }
